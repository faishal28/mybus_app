					<p>BRT was best suited in mid-size cities like Bhopal with lack or deficient bus services, where the social structure is basically middle class, where there is high demand, irrespective of availability of ROW, as it can operate in a mixed traffic situation also. BRT’s basic concept is to relieve road space by reducing the individual vehicles with low occupancy, by carrying them in a comfortable, time bound, mass transit mode. It was also examined how best BRT can be interfaced with the local bus system of Bhopal to accommodate the existing systems and their routes. Because of the constant rise in the number of motorized vehicles and growing affluence has manifested in the rise in number of cars in the Bhopal City. Hence there was a need to wean people away from private vehicles and persuade them to use public transport. The only way this could be done is by introducing a good Public Transport System; and BRTS was the best option for Bhopal city. </p>
					<p><b>To Improve the quality of service by providing dedicating lanes for modern buses and bus stops for increasing mobility.
Reduce pedestrian and SMV related accidents by separating them from FMV and Buses.
Facilitate reducing congestion in the mixed traffic lanes.
Separates FMV with SMV’s thereby increasing speed and capacity.</b></p>
					<p>With the unconditional support from Government of India & State government to provide the city of Bhopal a better public transport infrastructure Bhopal Municipal Corporation has been very keen in the up-gradation and enhancement of public transport in the city of Bhopal; It has embarked upon the idea of BRTS for the city of Bhopal. Out of four pre-identified corridors the longest Pilot Corridor (Misrod to Bairagarh) was sanctioned on 10th Nov 2006 and revised sanction was obtained on 21.06.2011 for an amount of Rs.368.62 cr with one ROB & 2 flyover comprising of a Length of 24 K.M.</p>

					<p><b>For speedy completion, the BRT corridor was divided into two contracts from Misrod (Chainage 00) to Board Office (Chainage 9300) and SBI Square (chainage 16600) to Sant Hirdaram nagar (Bairagarh end) (Chainage 23950) and Board Office (Chainage 9300) to SBI Square (Chainage 16600)
Construction of flyovers at Junctions and Railway over bridge at Habibganj Rly. crossing.
82 no. staggered kerb side Bus Stops (on both sides)
Bus Terminals & depot with all amenities
Utility ducts/ covered drain & cross drainage
State of art Electric poles</b>
</p>
					<p>The Corridor is being served by Low floor ultra modern Buses including 20 no. A.C. Buses in a central dedicated lane facilitated by 82 Nos. of State of Art BRTS Bus shelters at an average 500-700 M each have been proposed including to & fro bus movements with a desired 4-7 min frequency between any two buses in the same direction. BMC deputed a specialist transport consultant firm namely M/S EGIS BCEOM to look after the project execution for successful implementation of BRTS Bus operation and effectively incorporating all of its components–exclusive bus lane operations, improved infrastructure, signalized pedestrian crossing at grade, access to BRT stations, Bus priority signaling in openings & intersections, vehicle scheduling, ITS technology, traffic safety & information systems etc.  Before the start of the commercial operation of the buses, for the full two months, Bhopal city link limited (BCLL)/Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been conducting Dry/trial runs on the BRTS corridor with air-conditioned low-floor buses and other low floor buses. The dry run of BRTS buses started from 1st june 2013 and trial run of BRTS buses started from 15th june 2013 in the completed portion of BRTS corridor from Misrod to AMPRI (RRL intersection) and subsequently in the other portions of the BRTS corridor and continue for about 2 full months. Even during trial run MyBus was having 20,000 passengers per day but after launching of AC buses also it has increased tremendously.</p>
					<p>The Hon. Chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Sh. Shivraj Singh Chouhan dedicated “My Bus” services on 27th September to the public of Bhopal city by inaugurating the country’s longest 24 KM long BRTS corridor (From Misrod to Bairagarh ) passing through the heart of the Bhopal city. The BRTS Bus operation on the BRT corridor was successfully commenced from 27th sept, 2013 as “MY Bus” on Net–Cost Basis Contract through a private operator. Operates shall pay SD – 38% of the cost of buses. Bus operation is based on Net Cost Contract: Offer on Premium/Subsidy per bus Per Month Besides 38% investment towards Bus cost operator shall be liable to Operate & Maintain the entire Fleet & Assets under the project. This is the only example in the transport arena of the country or perhaps in the world that a private operator is operating the A.C. buses in the BRTS corridor on the net cost basis.</p>
					<p>My Bus services are equipped with state of art GPS system, Passenger information system, Passenger announcement system, CCTV cameras and other safety features. Bus priority signaling system and pedestrian crossing signal system is be provided. There is a provision of Zebra crossing for the movement of pedestrians to reach the bus stop/cross the road. Push button traffic signal are being installed at each zebra crossing location where the pedestrian can push the button and the traffic light will give a green signal at a predetermine time gap to allow for safe passage. The signals are synchronized with sensor to give priority to BRTS bus and pedestrians. The road sign of pedestrian crossing has been installed for vehicle drivers to see and watch the pedestrian crossing. Dedicated Squads for Safety and Efficiency of Bus Operation has been deployed. All low floor buses are tracked in control room on real time basis. The vehicle tracking unit devices have been installed on all the buses. GPS receiver modules, for bus stop announcement in the buses have also been installed on all the buses. The system has been planned & supported to maintain and monitor information for enhancing the performance of My Bus Services of BCLL and commuter satisfaction. The focus of planned Intelligent Transport System (PITS) is to automate the BCLL’s My Bus operations utilizing a GPS based vehicle Tracking & GIS based monitoring System and thereby improving the frequency and the service level benchmarks of the system. In this process My Bus services shall be able to provide better transport services to the commuters and by reducing the cost of operation directly & indirectly and thereby contribute in the improvement of the national economy.</p>
